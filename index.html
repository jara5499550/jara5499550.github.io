<p>I am expected to defend my Ph.D. at City University of Hong Kong (supervised by Prof. LI Wen Jung) in Aug 2023. My research interest lies in smart wearabale device fabrication and application.</p>

<p>During my Ph.D.’, I have been researching flexible sensors and smart wearable devices for human health-related physical activity and physiological signal monitoring. My doctoral thesis topic should be “Nanocomposite Smart Sensors for Human Physiological Monitoring”. Over the past four years (since autumn 2019), I have accumulated experience in the overall process of developing an intelligent flexible sensor-based wearable device, including nanomaterials and sensor fabrication, hardware architecture design, microcontroller programming, human subjects testing, and machine learning-based data process. With self-developed devices, I have mainly worked on the three projects on wearable devices as a major/leading contributor. Part of the related work has been published in Advanced Science, while others are in preparation and ready for submission.</p> 

<p>Based on my research experience and research interests, I would like to continue exploring more advanced technology on wearable devices for various applications in the future. My previous research focuses on physical sensors-based smart wearable devices for human physiological signals monitoring. On the basis of my experience, I want to expand my research furthermore. My advantage is that I have multidisciplinary experience (e.g., sensor fabrication, hardware architecture design, machine learning-based data process, etc.), which is required for smart wearable device development and applications. I am also very open to new technology, and other fields. Exploring new worlds makes me excited.</p>
